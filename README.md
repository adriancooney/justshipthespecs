# just ship the specs

**code is dead**

you don't need to read code anymore. you don't need to write it.
you need a comprehensive spec and an agent to build it.

lets stop shipping code to Github. just ship the specs.

## specs are the new abstraction

    machine code
      ↓ abstracted by
    code
      ↓ abstracted by
    specs ← you are here

## clean room builds

a clean room build means an agent builds the entire project
from specs alone. no existing codebase. no prior context.
no code to reference. just the specs.

every build is fresh. the code is a disposable build artifact.
the specs are the source of truth. markdown is king.

"my specs are building" is the new "my code is compiling"

---

## determinism

> but my build will be non-deterministic

skill issue. tighten your specs. agents can produce near identical builds.

---

## this is a new chapter

the movement is young. we need faster models. `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` is a glimpse
of the future. builds that take many hours today will take minutes tomorrow. ready your brain.

---

## work to do

- solve fast iteration
- build out a canonical spec repository + build cache
- make builds cheap

---

this site is a clean room build. no code was written by a human.
no code was read by a human. the specs are the entire source of truth.
